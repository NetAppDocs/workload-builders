FSx for ONTAP file system::
You need a minimum of one FSx for ONTAP file system:

* The file system will be used by Builders to store the projects and workspaces that you create. 
+
This FSx for ONTAP file system must use FlexVol volumes. FlexGroup volumes are not supported.

* You'll need to know the AWS region, VPC, and subnet where the AWS FSx for ONTAP file system resides.

* You'll need at least one volume in the filesystem with the following configuration:
** The volume must be configured as an NFS share.
** The filesystem must be configured with a link. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/links-overview.html[Learn more about links^].

* You'll need to consider the tag key/value pairs that you want to apply to the AWS resources that are part of this deployment (optional).
