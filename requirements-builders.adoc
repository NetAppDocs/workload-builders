Ensure that workload factory and AWS are set up properly before you begin using workload factory for Builders. This includes having your AWS log in credentials, a deployed FSx for ONTAP file system, and more.

Workload factory login and account::
You'll need to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/sign-up-saas.html[set up an account with Workload Factory^] and log in using one of the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].

AWS credentials and permissions::
You need to add AWS credentials to workload factory with automate permissions, which means you'll be using workload factory in _Automate_ mode for Builders.
+
_Basic_ mode and _Read_ mode permissions are not supported at this time.
+
When setting up your credentials, selecting permissions as shown below provides you with full access to manage FSx for ONTAP file systems and to deploy and manage Builders projects.

FSx for ONTAP file system::
You need a minimum of one FSx for ONTAP file system:

* The file system will be used by Builders to store the projects and workspaces that you create. 
+
This FSx for ONTAP file system must use FlexVol volumes. FlexGroup volumes are not supported.

* You'll need to know the AWS region, VPC, and subnet where the AWS FSx for ONTAP file system resides.

* You'll need at least one volume in the filesystem with the following configuration:
** The volume must be configured as an NFS share.
** The volume must be configured with a link. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/links-overview.html[Learn more about links^].

* You'll need to consider the tag key/value pairs that you want to apply to the AWS resources that are part of this deployment (optional).
