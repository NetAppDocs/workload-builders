You can manage EDA projects to control how your code and artifacts are managed for each project in NetApp Workload Factory for EDA. 

== Create a project

You can create a new EDA project so that you can leverage the data protection features of your Amazon FSX for NetApp ONTAP filesystem for your code and artifacts. 
.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. Select the menu image:workloads-menu-icon.png[The hamburger menu icon is used to navigate to workloads like storage, eda, ai, databases, vmware, and administration.] and then select *EDA*.
. Select *Create project*.  
. On the Create project page, provide the following:
.. *Project name*: Enter a name for the project.
.. *Description*: Enter a description for the project.
.. *Filesystem*: Provide the following:
... *Credentials*: Select the Amazon AWS credentials to use. EDA uses these credentials to discover FSx for ONTAP filesystems that you can use with this project and to create clones and snapshots of projects.
... *Region*: Select the region that this FSx for ONTAP filesystem resides in.
... *FSx for ONTAP filesystem*: Select an FSx for ONTAP filesystem to use with this project.
+
You can only select filesystems that are configured with a link. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/links-overview.html[Learn more about links^].
... *Choose a volume*: Select a volume on which to store the project; EDA uses this volume as a software repository.
+
You can only select volumes that are configured as an NFS share.
.. *Operation policies*: Provide limits for project clones:
... *Maximum retention in days*: Enter the maximum number of days that a clone should be retained. After this number of days, Workload Factory removes the clone.
... *Maximum number of clones per user or group*: Enter the maximum number of clones that can be provisioned for a user or group.
... *Maximum clone size in GiB*: Enter the maximum size in GiB of a project clone.
.. *Access policies*: Explicitly grant project access to specific users or groups:
... *Policy enforcement scope*: Enter single IP addresses or IP address ranges to limit project access to only those IP addresses or ranges.
+
For example: `172.16.0.0/24`
... *User or group identifiers*: Enter user or group identifiers to limit project access to only those users or groups.
+
For example: `User1234`
. Select *Create*. 

.Result
The project is created, and appears in the list of projects on the Projects page.
