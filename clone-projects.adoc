Work with different versions of your Builders projects by creating on-demand snapshots and clones directly from workload factory. Snapshots and clones of a project are stored in the filesystem that was associated with the project when it was created. You can also manage snapshots and clones using the https://console.workloads.netapp.com/api-doc[workload factory REST API^].
