=== Enhanced dashboard filtering with customizable tags

You can now configure up to five custom filters on the EDA dashboard based on your AWS tags. Each custom filter includes a label name, AWS tag key, and a selection type (single or multi-selection). Multi-selection allows you to select multiple values simultaneously, while single selection restricts you to one value at a time. Custom filters appear in the order you configure them, making it easy to organize your most frequently used filters.

If you don't configure custom filters, the default filters (file system, volume type, and time range) remain available so you can continue to view and interact with your dashboards.

=== Volume details view for granular performance analysis

The dashboard now offers two viewing modes: Total view and Volume view. The Total view displays aggregated metrics across all volumes, while the Volume view shows individual performance for the top 10 volumes over time. 

In Volume view, volumes are ranked differently for each component based on the relevant metric: Total volume provisioned and used capacity shows volumes with the highest current used capacity, Total IOPS shows volumes with the highest average IOPS during the selected time period, and Total throughput shows volumes with the highest average throughput.

Interactive hover tooltips provide detailed information for each volume, including volume name, metrics, and time-specific values. When the same volumes appear across multiple components, consistent color coding makes it easier to track specific volumes across different metrics.
