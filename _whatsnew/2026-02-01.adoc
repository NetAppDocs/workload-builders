=== Enhanced dashboard filtering with customizable tags

You can now configure up to five custom filters on the EDA dashboard based on your AWS tags. Each custom filter includes a label name, AWS tag key, and a selection type (single or multi-selection). Multi-selection allows you to select multiple values simultaneously, while single selection restricts you to one value at a time. Custom filters appear in the order you configure them, making it easy to organize your most frequently used filters.

If you don't configure custom filters, the default filters (file system, volume type, and time range) remain available so you can continue to view and interact with your dashboards.

=== Volume details view for granular performance analysis

The dashboard now offers two viewing modes: Total view and Volume view. The Total view displays aggregated metrics across all volumes, while the Volume view shows individual performance for the top 10 volumes over time. 

In Volume view, volumes are ranked differently for each component based on the relevant metric: Total volume provisioned and used capacity shows volumes with the highest current used capacity, Total IOPS shows volumes with the highest average IOPS during the selected time period, and Total throughput shows volumes with the highest average throughput.

Interactive hover tooltips provide detailed information for each volume, including volume name, metrics, and time-specific values. When the same volumes appear across multiple components, consistent color coding makes it easier to track specific volumes across different metrics.

=== Latency analysis for proactive performance monitoring

Latency analysis enables you to monitor volume read and write latency across your FSx for ONTAP file systems. Configure customizable warning and critical event thresholds to proactively identify performance bottlenecks before they impact your EDA workloads.

The feature collects CloudWatch metrics at least every 20 minutes and triggers alerts when both latency and IOPS thresholds are breached for all data points within your specified time range (5-20 minutes). You can configure 12 threshold parameters, including separate read and write latency thresholds for both warning events (default: 6ms read, 8ms write) and critical events (default: 12ms read, 15ms write).

The latency events table displays all warning and critical events from the past 72 hours, showing details such as volume name, file system, time detected, and median latency during the breach period. You can sort events by any column and dismiss resolved issues. The table shows only the latest breach for each volume and automatically removes events after 72 hours.

This feature requires AWS credentials and is accessible from the Latency menu in the EDA dashboard.
