You can customize your dashboard by adding AWS tags to your FSx for ONTAP volumes to collect CloudWatch metrics in the dashboard. Your dashboard becomes a dynamic tool for organizing, tracking costs, and filtering resources based on your organizational needs.

AWS tags are metadata for your AWS resources. They help you categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. For more details about tagging, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/what-are-tags.html[What are tags?^] and  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/overview.html[AWS Resource Groups Tagging API Reference^].
