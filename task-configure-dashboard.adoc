When you first sign in to EDA, you can use the project dashboard to monitor system activities at a glance.

The dashboard contains information about system health and performance and storage use. 

For an explanation of the information shown on each card, select the information icon for that card.

=== Configure the dashboard

To effectively use the dashboard, configure AWS tags on your FSx for ONTAP volumes. When they are configured add them to your dashboard to collect CloudWatch metrics. 

The metrics collected include:

* Total provisioned 
* Total used
* Average throughput 
* Average IOPS 

Your dashboard becomes a dynamic tool for organizing, tracking costs, and filtering resources based on your organizational needs.

AWS tags are metadata for your AWS resources. They help you categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by project, application, or business unit. For more details about tagging, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/what-are-tags.html[What are tags?^] and  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/overview.html[AWS Resource Groups Tagging API Reference^].
