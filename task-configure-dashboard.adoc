When you first sign in to EDA, you can use the project dashboard to observe volume usage across your FSx for ONTAP file systems.

The dashboard helps you monitor storage usage for capacity allocated, capacity used, throughput, and IOPS. 

=== Configure the dashboard

To effectively use the dashboard, first configure AWS tags on your FSx for ONTAP volumes based on your business requirements. When they are configured, add them to your dashboard to begin collecting and viewing CloudWatch metrics.

AWS tags are metadata for your AWS resources. They help you categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by project, application, or business unit. For more details about tagging, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/what-are-tags.html[What are tags?^] and  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/overview.html[AWS Resource Groups Tagging API Reference^].

Your dashboard becomes a dynamic tool for organizing, tracking costs, and filtering resources based on your organizational needs.

The metrics collected include:

* Total provisioned: Volume-level metric representing the StorageCapacity.
* Total used: Volume-level metric representing the StorageUsed.
* Average throughput: Calculated as the average of the sum of DataReadBytes and DataWriteBytes over the specified time period.
* Average IOPS: Calculated as the average of the sum of DataReadOperations, DataWriteOperations, and MetadataOperations over the specified time period.

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. Select the menu image:workloads-menu-icon.png[The hamburger menu icon is used to navigate to workloads like storage, eda, ai, databases, vmware, and administration.] and then select *EDA*.
+
If you have not already configured your dashboard, you are automatically prompted to do so.
. For each filter required, add a filter label name and the AWS tag key name you want to associate with it.
. Select *Apply*.
. To edit the dashboard configuration later, select *Configure*.
. To view your changes after applying any tags or filters, select the refresh icon on the dashboard.

=== Filter the dashboard

You can filter the information displayed on the dashboard by selecting one or all of the following:

* Credentials
* Region
* File system
* Volume type
* Time range

When you have selected your required filters, select the refresh icon to update the dashboard information.
